# Project: Visualization 

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to make a presentation on the conclusions you have drawn from a database with the help of a dashboard or storyteeling. The purpose of this project is to learn how to extract information from the data, represent it using one of the visualization tools we know and draw a series of conclusions from which we have to make a presentation. 

# Steps

-First of all, we must choose the data from which we want to extract information. This data can be from an ETL that we have previously done or we can use other data that we want. When we have the data we have to see if we have only a table or a relational database that we have to connect with the visualization tool we use.

-Then, we review the data in each table and the relationship between them to know what queries we can do and the information we can extract. 

-Once we have our visualization tool (Power BI in my case) connected to the database we have to establish our objectives and the questions we are asking ourselves that we want to get an answer to. In this case, it has been a bit complicated as we had nothing set and no restrictions. 

-When making the Dashboard, one of the most important parts is to be able to get to the data that will later answer our questions. Once you have the data you are going to use, you have to choose very well with which visualization element you are going to represent it depending on the corporate image, the target audience, the department...etc.

- Finally, with the Dashboard or Dashboards done, you have to create a story so that the public that is going to see the project understands the problem and the conclusions and study the way in which you are going to present it.


# Final conclusions 

-With this project I have understood why visualization tools are so important nowadays in companies as they allow you to both perform an analysis part and be able to represent it in a way that everyone can understand and draw conclusions.
